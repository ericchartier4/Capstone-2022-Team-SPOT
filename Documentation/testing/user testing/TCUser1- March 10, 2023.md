Objective for user
- sign up as a new user

- check the ' scans' tab on your new scan 

Observations and comments from user:
- In the sign up:
  - The Date of Birth should be a calander instead of a text feild 
  - For the error snackbars , make them last longer so the user can read the error , esspecially if it is providoing information on how to recify the error 
  - user commented on the lack of  password requirements on sign up 
- In the home page:
  - the ' about this app' section is too much text, reccomended putting text into an accordion tab 
- Adding a new scan photo:
  - after the user has put in a new image, user suggested changing the wording of the "choose photo" button that would take the user to the next page where they can add details to their scan. 
- after submitting scan at the view details page:
  - we need a loading bar or something to prevent user from clicking button twice and submmiting more than one photo at a time. 
  - user suggested adding a glossary as they did not know what the words Benign or malignent ment 
- at the home screen clicking the 'scans' button 
  - user suggested better wording  for the 'scans' button name, not really descriptive in what it does
