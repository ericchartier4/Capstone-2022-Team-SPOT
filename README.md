#Project Idea: 

Our original goal is to build an AI application that users can upload images of their skin and this application will tell them whether they might have melanoma (skin cancer).
But upon completion of the AI to detectect melanoma, the Project scope has widened to include the  detection of the seven most comon skin diseases:  
*  Bowen's disease
*  Basal cell carcinoma
*  Benign keratosis-like lesions 
*  Melanoma
*  Melanocytic nevi
*  Vascular lesions

# Project background/Business Opportunity

We choose to do this AI application because it fulfils one of the 17 goals of the UN: good health and well-being. According to our research, the international average diagnosis price of melanoma is $150 USD per month, and the total cost of a patient could reach $3800 - $8000. Furthermore, the cost of skin cancer treatment varies from $4960 to $170,515, the later the stages the higher the cost. We decided to develop an application that is easily accessible to everyone at little or no cost, and we aim to diagnose melanoma as early as possible and thereby to save the patients from suffering and economic losses.  There are existing applications that provide similar services, however, according to research overseen by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) dermatologists Veronica Rotemberg and Allan Halpern reported that the overall accuracy of the apps that were evaluated was only 59%. Today is the era that the application of convolution algorithm on image recognition has become mature, and therefore we choose convolution as our primary algorithm and this should provide us with a much higher accuracy rate.
